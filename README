Video/PlaybackMachine version 0.01
==================================

Video::PlaybackMachine. Instant television station. Just add content.

Seriously, it's a multimedia scheduled playback system. You can
schedule movies to be played at a specific time and date, and the
system will play them back at that time. Whenever it's not playing
scheduled content, it plays music and shows slides and "up next"
informational screens.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Then, to install the required Postgres database, type:

   createdb playback_machine
   psql -f sql/playback_machine_dd.sql

Probably also a good idea to copy the contents of the php/ directory
into a PHP-enabled directory someplace. Take care; the PHP scripts are
simple, but I haven't reviewed them for security as
yet. Password-protect them at least.
