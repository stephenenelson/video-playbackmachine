####
#### $Revision$
####
#### A TimeLayout that indicates that the FillProducer can produce
#### content for a certain minimum and a certain maximum amount of
#### time.
####
#### An example is the FillShort producer, which plays short films.
#### It has short films available to it in a certain range of sizes.
#### It would return a RangeLayout consisting of the time of the
#### shortest short for the minimum and the time of the longest
#### fitting short for the maximum.
####
#### NOTE: Not currently in use. May be removed shortly.
