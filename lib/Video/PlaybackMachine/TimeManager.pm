# TODO: I'm not sure that the implemented algorithm is correct. To get
# the effects I'm looking for, basically the TimeManager should go
# through in priority order and assign time slots to the Fill
# Producers based on minimum and preferred time, stopping when we're
# full.  Actual playback then follows sequence order. Preassignment
# may be against some of the PM philosophy of constantly reacting to
# the current situation, but is essential for getting some of the
# effects that we want (such as "play fills before and after a short
# movie, and ALWAYS do station identification")
#
# Later update: The algorithm actually works as well, if not better,
# than the above. It gets the amount of time remaining, and the amount
# of time required, and the amount of time required by items of a
# higher priority, and computes the remainder.

##
## Returns the FillSegment to use to fill up time right now. Returns
## undef if no more fill can be played.
